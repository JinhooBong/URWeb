# URWeb

An online platform for local students to offer and seek tutoring services. 
Built for University of Richmond's local hack-a-thon, SpiderHacks. 
Placed 2nd with this web application. 

## Information

It uses HTML and CSS for the front-end side and uses PHP to connect it to a local database built using MySQL. 
Students can come to this website, log in or sign up to bascially offer tutoring services to other local students, or seek help from their peers. 
Students can post local events happening around school, or if their club is hosting an event, they can post that on there too. 
Our goal was focused on building and growing the community at the school, and thought creating a tutoring website would help foster that mentality.
