          <p>
            The unique environment of a college campus allows individuals with a diverse set of knowledge, talents, and experiences to come together and learn new ideas while also developing old ones. URWeb connects students who may need assistance in a particular subject field with peers who have been in their shoes before. We capitalize on the strength of the university culture by giving students the tools they need in order to master a new area of study- each other!

              <h3>How does URWEB work?</h3>
              <p>
                  It all starts with creating an account. Don’t worry- you don’t have to be in need of tutoring or want to tutor just yet. When you’re ever in need of some help, you’ll be able to search for available tutors in your subject area using our complex algorithm. After finding a potential tutor, you’ll have the opportunity to contact them through email or text  Or, if you’re ever free and want to give someone some guidance, you can post date and times when you’re available to meet. It’s as simple as that!
